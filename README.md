# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN
Potato diseases are the leading cause of the decline in the quality and quantity of the harvest. Inappropriate classification and late detection of the disease's type will drastically worsen the plant conditions. Therefore, a system is developed to classify the two types of diseases in potato plants (Early Blight and Late Blight) based on leaf conditions by utilising convolutional neural network architecture model to obtain an accurate classification system. This experiment has achieved an average accuracy of 98%, which indicates the feasibility of the deep neural network approach.
